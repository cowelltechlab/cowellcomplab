abstract: "Large Language Models are often trained on data reflecting neurotypical norms, yet are increasingly deployed to support neurodivergent users in sensitive domains like job-seeking. We examine interactions between neurodivergent job-seekers and a GPT-4-powered career support chatbot through the lens of misalignment. Through analysis of over 300 chat logs and interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants, we found that the chatbot frequently misrepresented users’ skills, imposed neurotypical language and expectations, and provided generic or inappropriate advice– even when relevant user data was available. Participants expected the chatbot to interpret implicit insights from their data, however, they sometimes lacked the clarity or confidence to correct the system when it did not, revealing gaps in both AI design and user understanding of system function. Our findings underscore the need for bi-directional alignment between neurodivergent users and LLMs, and call for design strategies that integrate neurodivergent perspectives and preferences to ensure more authentic, personalized, and human-centered AI support."
